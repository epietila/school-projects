This is a course project for Programming 3: Interfaces and Techniques. It is implemented as a pair work in close collaboration so that clearly separating our contribution is not feasible. However, most of the graphical design is implemented by Ronja Koivisto and majority of the backend by me, Essi Pietil√§. I have consent of Ronja to present this work. More details about the program can be read in Finnish in the documentation file.
